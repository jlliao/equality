		<p><strong>This is a story of how economic inequality takes place and how we can diminish it.</strong></p>
		<p>
			Let's start with a simple environment, where there are only patches of grains.
			Each patch has an amount of grain and a grain capacity (the amount of grain it can grow).
			As shown in the graph below, the darker a green patch, the higher its grain capacity. 
		</p>

		<img src="play/img/grain_environment.png" width="400" height="400" scrolling="no" style="margin:0 auto;display:block">

		<p>
			Then we have people collecting grain from the patches. 
			They need to eat the grain to survive and how much grain each person accumulates is his or her wealth.
			The model begins with a roughly equal wealth distribution. 
			The people then wander around the landscape gathering as much grain as they can. 
			Each person attempts to move in the direction where the most grain lies. 
			Each time tick, each person eats a certain amount of grain. 
			This amount is called their metabolism. 
			People also have a life expectancy. 
			When their lifespan runs out, or they run out of grain, they die and produce a single offspring. 
			The offspring has a random metabolism and a random amount of grain, ranging from the poorest person’s amount of grain to the richest person’s amount of grain.
		</p>

		<p>
			To observe the equity (or the inequity) of the distribution of wealth, a graphical tool called the Lorenz curve is utilized. 
			We rank the population by their wealth and then plot the percentage of the population that owns each percentage of the wealth (e.g. 30% of the wealth is owned by 50% of the population). 
			Hence the ranges on both axes are from 0% to 100%.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:center">
			<b>
			If Lorenz curve is closer towards the diagonal line, the wealth distribution is more equal.

			And... our society becomes extremely inequal, as most people are in the lower class and very few people are in the middle and upper class.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, our society does not always have large amounts of resources.
			Sometimes our natural conditions are good, but sometimes they are not.
			To reflect these changes in the model, we implement seasonal changes in grain growth. 
			In a good season, the grain growth is good.
			In a bad season, the growth is bad.

			We observe that there is some effect that inheritance has.
			In fact, if an offspring is allowed to inherit more, the more equal the society.
			Percent of Inheritance may not have huge impact on agents in upper class, since their wealth is already exceedingly large.
			But for agents in lower class, more inheritance means larger chance for their offspring to survive.

			However, in reality, agents may give birth to more than one child.
			Moreover, the parent's amount that is not inherited by his/her offspring should be given to a tax agency for other usage.
			Hence, an improved, more realistic model is build.
			In the model below, agents are not only able to give birth to more than one child, but their inheritance is also taxed based on their respective classes.

			This resembles income tax in the real world.

			Wow! Finally we see some improvement on equality, 
			as we can observe that there are fewer agents in the lower class and number of middle class starts to grow.

		<p>
			First, we need to think about young and elderly.
			They have no working ability (as in, the ability to harvest grains).
			Therefore, we need to distribute grant to support young children and pension to support elderly.

			Secondly, we need to use the money to support lower class.
			In our model, we simply redistribute the rest of tax money to lower class.

			WRAPPING UP:
		</div>
		<p>
			<b>1. Economic changes have more impact on the lower class.</b>
			<br>
			Changing economic environment does not affect the comfortable life of a wealthy people, 
			but hugely affect the survival of the poorest.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>2. Charge taxes improve equality in wealth distribution.</b>
			<br>
			Inheritance tax and income tax may seem very little compared to the whole weath of a society,
			they are effective to diminish inequality and improve the well-being of all.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>3. Support the young, the elderly, and the poor.</b>
			<br>
			Children cannot survive without the support of public, 
			and grandparents cannnot have a comfortable life without some pensions.
			When the lower class does not have time and efforts to search for better resources beyond its own survival, 
			the society needs to provide extra financial support.

				Our wealth distribution model is based off the work of Uri Wilensky. 
				Specifically, his 1998 model,
				<a target="_blank" href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WealthDistribution">Wealth Distribution.</a>
				We built on top of this, demonstrated the inequality in wealth distribution, 
				and showed how different approaches can help diminish it.

				<br><br>

				There are other models that have taken different approach on how to model the taxation system.
				You might enjoy looking at an alternative model with dynamic tax system, such as this one,
